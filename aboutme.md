I'm currently a final year MEng Computing student at Swansea University. I am currently in search of a software engineering job for next year (July 2018 onwards). So far my life at Univeristy has been going pretty well! I'm on track for a 1st in my degree this year, and have yet to receive lower than a 1st average in any of my previously completed modules.

Since I'm going to University at Swansea, I'm based in Wales at the moment. I will primarily be searching for jobs within Wales, but I'm certainly open to offers from the rest of the UK.

### Interests (including some projects I've worked on based on them)

I am interested in way too many tech fields to mention here, but some of the main ones are:

- Evolutionary algorithms (See my ['Evolutionary Game'](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/EvolutionaryGame) project)
- Neural networks (See my ['Generic Neural Network'](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/GenericBackpropNN) project)
- Other machine learning approaches and technologies
- Game development (See my aforementioned ['Evolutionary Game'](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/EvolutionaryGame) project)
- Graphics hardware

Really though, if there's a tech that's often mentioned in recent news, or plays a big part in society, then I'm probably pretty interested in it.
