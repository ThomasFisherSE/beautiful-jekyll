I'm currently a final year MEng Computing student at Swansea University. I am currently in search of a software engineering job for next year (July 2018 onwards). So far my life at Univeristy has been going pretty well! I'm on track for a 1st in my degree this year, and have yet to receive lower than a 1st average in any of my previously completed modules.

### Interests (including some projects I've worked on based on them)

I am interested in way too many fields to mention here, but some of the main ones are:

- Evolutionary algorithms (See my ['Evolutionary Game'](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/EvolutionaryGame) project)
- Neural networks (See my ['Generic Neural Network'](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/GenericBackpropNN) project)
- Other machine learning approaches and technologies
- Game development (See my aforementioned ['Evolutionary Game'](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/EvolutionaryGame) project)
- Graphics hardware
