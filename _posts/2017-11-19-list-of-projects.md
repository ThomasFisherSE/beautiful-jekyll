I've worked on lots of projects throughout University. Here's a list of them all, with links!

## [Evolutionary Game in Unity](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/EvolutionaryGame)

A space shooter game where enemy ships improve through successive waves using a genetic algorithm. 
This project is my final year MEng Computing individual project at Swansea University. As of the date of this post, it is my current main project.

## [Generic Backpropagation Neural Network in C++](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/GenericBackpropNN)

This provides a generic structure for a simple feedforward / backpropagation artificial neural network in C++.
This project was completed for my third year Computing dissertation at Swansea University.

## [Kablewie - Minesweeper Clone in Java](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/Kablewie-Minesweeper)

In the second year of my degree, I was tasked with creating a minesweeper clone called 'Kablewie' in a team-based project.

## [Kablewie+ - Upgraded Minesweeper Clone in Java](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/KablewiePlus-Minesweeper)

Later in the second year of my degree, I was provided with a piece of software (a minesweeper clone 'Kablewie') that another group of developers had created and tasked with updating it and integrating advanced features into the game. This is similar to the previously mentioned 'Kablewie' project, but with added features such as saving / loading, a self-playing AI, and option to reveal the location of mines.

## [Game Suite in Java](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/Java-GameSuite)

Once 'Kablewie' was finished, I created another game similar to the popular board game 'Ludo'. I gave this some extra features to the board game such as computer player AI that you could play against. Putting the two games together, I created a Java game suite, where either of the games can be launched.

## [Merkles Puzzles in Java](https://github.com/ThomasFisherSE/Merkles-Puzzles-Implementation)

In my third year of University, I was tasked with a pair-programming project to demonstrate how the cryptographic key-exchange approach 'Merkles's puzzles' works.
